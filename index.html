          is a favorite language of developers building interactive
          web applications. If an app involves users creating accounts,
          entering information, and interacting with dynamic content,
          there's a good chance it is built with Ruby. Ruby became popular
          because the Rails framework, which is written with Ruby,
          simplified many of the common tasks associated with
          building web applications. It's most popular with startups and
          smaller companies who are looking to build their product quickly.</p>

          is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages,
          including colors, layout, fonts, and other stylistic choices.
          It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices,
          such as large screens, small screens, and printers. HTML — used for
          building the structure of the page — and CSS — used for the
          visual layout — are the two basic languages involved in the building of
          web pages and web applications.

          is most popular among bigger established businesses, often for building
          internal software. Because it's been around for a long time and
          has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the most in-demand languages
          in the job market. C# has also been going through a bit of a rebirth
          lately, with Microsoft open sourcing the language and surrounding platform,
          porting it to run on Mac and Linux, and incorporating many of the
          best features of other languages. If you like the idea of working for
          a larger company on business software, C# is a great choice.
